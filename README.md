IR remote control
Hello! This library is desined for STM32 microcontrollers. STM32f4xx series are default.
All you need to use it is MCU with timer wroking as input capture. I reccomend to use TIM2 channel 1 
as default, but you can change for whatever you want! Next requirement is TIM clock running on 16 MHz (default).
So care have to be taken if you want to change this value.
